**This is my playground about Tree, Java Testing, and possibly Concurrently access on Tree**

TODO: 
- add test case on inorder, preorder, postorder, BFS traversal of SimpleBinarySearchTree
- add String test case on inorder, preorder, postorder
- add BFS level traversal for easy debugging
- add tree drawing algo for SimpleBSTNode
